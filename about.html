  <h3>Second generation shines through Three&nbsp;Coins</h3>
</div>

<div id="body">

  <p>Three Coins Cast Aluminum Furniture Company has been transformed following an exchange of hands to its second generation.</p>

  <p><q>The painstaking effort to transform the old Three Coins Import into the new TC Castings LLC has been a rewarding journey,</q> said Susanna Powell, who has led Three Coins since her parents Gordon and Linda Ramsey decided to take their retirement at a more leisurely pace.</p>

  <p><q>My parents started this company 15 years ago as a retirement hobby with some friends,</q> Powell said. <q>What began as a hobby for them has turned into a real passion for me. In the past four years I have slowly taken over and brought new innovations to the plant, streamlined the product and added new and exciting product and finishes.</q></p>

  <p>In addition to launching extensive deep seating collections and its own cushion line, Powell led a return to the company's roots in Mexico, where the pieces are cast in sand. All of the welding, grinding and hand-painted finishing is done in Newnan, Ga., she said.</p>

  <p><q>There is never a show that goes by without someone letting us know the difference they see between our pieces and others,</q> Powell said. <q>With a heavy machinery and aircraft paint as a base and handcrafted finishing, we can offer a quality and diversity you just can't find in a box from China.</q></p>

  <p>Ray Barnoski relied on his 20 years of experience in quality control to help Powell make improvements in every area of production from welding through hand-finishing. As a company practice, customers' thank you messages and notes now are shared among employees to show their hard work is being appreciated. They feel proud to have their pieces featured in the current July-September edition of Oprah at Home and on the cover of <a href="http://www.horchow.com/">Horchow&rsquo;s</a> summer catalog.</p>

  <p>Three Coins will exhibit at the Sept. 18-19 <a href="http://www.hdboutique.com/">HD Boutique</a> Miami, booth 1764. Next month, its products will be shown at the <a href="http://www.highpointmarket.org/">High Point Market</a>, Oct. 20-26, in the International Home Furnishings Center, Main 126.</p>

  <p>At the January 2009 <a href="http://www.americasmart.com/">Atlanta Gift Show</a>, Three Coins will move into AmericasMart Building 2 West, booth A18 Promenade and booth A27 Maple Walk. It will return to the HD Expo in Las Vegas in May.</p>
